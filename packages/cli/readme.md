# ES6 tool migration 

CLI to convert JavaScript files from [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) to [ES6 modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) (aka ES2015 modules, aka JavaScript modules, aka hipster `require()`). 

This tool uses [5to6-codemod](https://github.com/5to6/5to6-codemod) under the hood. It's basically just a thin convenience wrapper, which can process multiple files and convert both `import`s and `export`s.

Inspired by [csj-to-es6](https://github.com/nolanlawson/cjs-to-es6).

```

```
